Dear MNO Community,

Over the first term of the Dash Investment Foundation, the
previous round of supervisors made an operational decision that the
current round of supervisors feel is ineffective in
the way the DIF currently operates. Legally, the DIF supervisors have a
fiduciary duty to the network and have operational
control over the funds the DIF holds.

In the course of DIF business operations, DIF supervisors are
meeting and discussing many sensitive and private topics with potential
investment opportunities - topics which are necessary to assess
the risks and opportunities that may result from an investment - and
are at most times legally bound (e.g., under NDA) to not discuss the
information shared.

Many community members express the frustration of being asked to
weigh in on DIF investment opportunities through decision proposals
without the benefit of full access to information. It is impossible
for MNOs to effectively assess opportunities in this manner. We
therefore feel that as representatives of the network entrusted with our
roles as supervisors, we should act in the best interests
of the network as intended.

In order to more streamline the operations within the DIF to be able
to offer the network the best service in terms of directing
investments toward the best opportunities; the current round of supervisors
has taken a unanimous decision to discontinue seeking
MNO approval for each individual investment decision. The DIF supervisors
will instead exercise their responsibility to make
investment decisions on behalf of the network, allowing the MNO community to
continue to influence the operations of the DIF via the
selection of the supervisors and funding proposals.

Seeking approval for each investment was well-intentioned. While we value
decentralization, we also recognize that tasking the MNOs
with decision making that could only be effective with information
inaccessible to them makes little sense. We believe this new
approach will result in better outcomes for the network we represent.

-DIF Supervisors
